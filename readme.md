# Deceased
Likely won't work on this project anymore. There's a chance, but I have no interest at the moment.

A simple Chat room made using Electron, A Websocket and MySQL.

## Notice

At this moment in time this branch is unstable as is the rest of the branches.
For a stable branch please go to the [1.0.0 archive](https://github.com/BackwardsUser/Basic-Chat-Room/tree/1.0.0-(Archive)) branch.

If you do install this app via this branch or other unstable branches, note that it is provided **as is** and updates will come out as I work on them, If you do download via unstable branches please do not demand/badger me for features/updates, updates will be rolled out while I work on this. I do am not working on it full time and am only working on it in my free time.

### Road Map and Updates

For a road map of whats to come and features to expect check out the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/aZmNGbJa/backwards-chatrooms)!

I am not too dedicated to sticking to the board, some features may shift around a lot, it depends on what I feel like releasing at certain times. However key features **will** release with the given release version, They are listed (top -> bottom) of importance, Wherein things closer to the top will be released with the version while things near the bottom could shift to later versions.

I am 100% pushing for Messaging and a Built release for 0.0.0, Message Encryption could be pulled from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0, depends on whether I just want the release to get out, or not.

Although Themes could be pushed to a later version depending on how complicated it may get. (Whether I choose to allow users to make custom themes)

The Login System is Important, so it may also be pulled to 0.0.0, but I want to get something to protect in order first, also I have some ideas I'm considering for security, however I want to get some things off my plate before diving into a project of such variability, Especially considering I have no idea how to integrate accounts into an electron app at this moment in time.

Another thing about updates is not every Minor Release may get Built Release, I may just rely on the Updater to update existing users and have new users download old Builds and have the updater update the current build, depending on how lazy I get around release time.

Note, the road map could never receive another update, I do like the idea of keeping things organized like that, but I'm likely not going to follow it whatsoever, so I feel its an unnecessary tool. Although if I can stick to it, at least for release 0.0.0 - 0.1.0, I may keep it, also if I cannot think of anymore ideas to add to it, I may get rid of it anyways.

If you have any suggestions for what you'd like to see my chatroom do (something that others may not do) feel free to ask me, I know in other places of this readme I speak as if I'm not open to suggestions, I am; I just don't want to be badgered to add a low priority feature when the rooms, guilds, servers, whatever I plan to call them don't even work. So again, feel free to ask, but please only ask once.

### Installation

At this moment in time there isn't much to install.
This will be updated when there is usable content.

### Contribution

Feel free to create a Fork and Pull Request! I am completely open to contributions!
If you have any suggestions for what I should name the Application feel free to let me know! @backwardsuser on Discord.

**IMPORTANT** If you do contact me VIA Discord, please make sure you message me your intentions, **DO NOT** Message me "Hi", "Hello", "I have something to tell you", or anything vague like that, I **will** decline your message and may block you, there are way to many people out there that freak me out doing that and I will not respond to anyone trying to contact me like that.


### Notes

I plan to host my own (home hosted) server of this application. I am based in South East Canada (US East) So my server may not be the first choice for European Users.

Once this app becomes stable I plan to push support for all my projects onto it, of course certain important/discord related projects will still be found on Discord, more specifically my Discord Server [Backwards Development](https://discord.gg/BbCqbuU8Qx), however support will be found for every project on this app.

I may also release a single guild server (like TeamSpeak) So you can create a local server for friends without the hassle of having to maintain the weight of multiple servers.

If you want to name this app, feel free to shoot me a message on Discord @ backwardsuser or on my Discord Server [Backwards Development](https://discord.gg/BbCqbuU8Qx), I really have no idea for names so any suggestions are greatly appreciated, although for now the name will stay Basic Chat Room, Even though its become less basic than it once was, lol.
